Storing the URLs in a set is a smart way to prevent duplicates.\n\nThe `closed` method is also helpful for saving the collected URLs to a file for later use.\n\n**Suggestion:**\n\nSince you're interested in the site tree structure, you might want to consider using the `Scrapy` shell to explore the HTML structure of the pages within the `Learn` section. This can help you identify any specific patterns or elements that could be useful for further analysis or processing.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or need help with specific aspects of your spider."
